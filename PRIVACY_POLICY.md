# Brainrot Blocker Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 17, 2026

Brainrot Blocker is a browser extension that helps users reduce distraction by blocking selected websites and tracking focus sessions.

## Data We Collect

1. Local extension settings:
- blocked sites
- allowed paths
- productive sites/apps
- session preferences (work/reward durations, strict mode, penalties)

2. Optional account data (only if you sign in):
- Auth provider identity token data
- display name and profile image URL

3. Optional usage analytics (only when backend sync is enabled and reachable):
- session start/end events
- minutes completed
- blocked-attempt counts
- optional reminder note text (if user enters one)

## How Data Is Used

1. To run core functionality (blocking, timers, settings).
2. To provide optional leaderboard and cross-device config sync.
3. To improve reliability and prevent abuse.

## Data Storage

1. Core settings are stored locally in `chrome.storage.local`.
2. If signed in, selected profile/session/config data may be stored on the Brainrot Blocker backend.
3. Companion app mode may read local desktop process names for app productivity/blocking on your device.
4. Brainrot Blocker does not ask for card numbers, bank account numbers, or payment credentials.

## Data Sharing

1. We do not sell personal data.
2. We do not share personal data with third parties for advertising.
3. Auth and infrastructure providers process data only to operate the service.

## Your Choices

1. You can use extension-only mode with no companion app.
2. You can sign out at any time to disable account-linked features.
3. You can clear extension data by removing the extension or clearing browser extension storage.

## Security

We use reasonable technical measures to protect data in transit and at rest, but no system is completely secure.
