Project Name:

Brainrot Blocker

Elevator Pitch

Brainrot Blocker is a hilariously guilt-trippy Chrome extension that locks distracting sites during "Lock In" sessions, banks your earned reward minutes, and punishes every cheat with escalating shame GIFs like "your grandmother is disappointed" and "LITERAL DUMPSTER FIRE ACHIEVED" while a leaderboard lets you flex your streaks.

Built for students, founders, and anyone who swears they'll work but doomscrolls instead, it turns scattered minutes into measurable productivity. Reclaiming an hour a day compounds into real progress.

Short elevator pitch:

Brainrot Blocker locks distracting sites, earns you reward minutes for real work, and roasts every cheat with escalating shame GIFs, then ranks your focus streak on a leaderboard.
