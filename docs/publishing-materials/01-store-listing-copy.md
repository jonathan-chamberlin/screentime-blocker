## Extension Name

`Brainrot Blocker`

## Short Description

`Block distracting sites, run Lock In sessions, and earn break time through real productivity.`

## Detailed Description

Brainrot Blocker is a focus extension that adds friction to distraction.

How it works:

1. Start a Lock In session.
2. Your blocked sites are locked.
3. The work timer runs only while you are on productive sites (or productive desktop apps in companion mode).
4. Completing a work cycle earns break time.
5. You can spend earned break time on distracting sites, then return to focus mode.

Included features:

- Session-based website blocking
- Reward time system (earn and burn)
- Escalating shame screens on blocked attempts
- Nuclear Block with staged cooldown-based unblocking
- Productivity check popup (approve site or block it)
- Strict mode (no early exit until threshold is met)
- Early exit penalty reminders (no payment processing)
- Optional sign-in for leaderboard features
- Optional companion app mode for desktop app tracking/blocking

Important notes:

- Extension-only website blocking works out of the box.
- Companion app mode is optional and requires native host installation.
- Payment penalties are reminder-only and do not process payments.
